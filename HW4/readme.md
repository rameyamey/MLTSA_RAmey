This file contains my HW4 submissions exploring point of change models and how to deal with outliers. 

Collaborators: Rachel Amey, Alima Nurlan, Priyanka Mondal, Ramiz Qudsi

Contributions: R. Amey advised A. Nurlan on how to construct the equations in the chchchchanges assignment. R. Amey also advised P. Mondal on interpreting the figures in the MCMCOutliers assignment. R. Qudsi was essential in R. Amey's understanding of the equation coding (especially equation 13) in the MCMCOutlier assignment and lingering questions in chchchchanges. He was also essential in troubleshooting python errors in both workbooks and questions we both had during the assignment.
