This file contains my HW6 submission classifying astrophysical transients from photometry.

Collaborators: Rachel Amey, Ramiz Qudsi

Contributions: R. Amey and R. Qudsi worked equally on the project. R. Qudsi was essential by helping the group troubleshoot python errors. R. Amey was able to find small differences between the coding of Random Forest and Gradient Boosted trees to ensure each model ran correctly.
